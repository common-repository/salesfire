Ensure you have bumped the version inside of readme.txt and salesfire.php, and added an entry to Changelog within the readme.txt.

# Cloning SVN

You need to clone svn, e.g. into a svn/ directory.

```
svn checkout --depth immediates https://plugins.svn.wordpress.org/salesfire svn
```

(You will need to login with username/password for WordPress login.)

You can create another folder called working-env with a installation of WordPress. Inside the plugins you can clone the `salesfire` plugin from GitHub.

# Updating SVN

You will need to copy the working plugin into the trunk/ within /svn, e.g.

```
rsync -rc --exclude-from="../working-env/wp-content/plugins/salesfire/.distignore" "../working-env/wp-content/plugins/salesfire/" trunk/ --delete --delete-excluded
```

(You will also need to copy across .wordpress-org folder if necessary.)

Run following:

```
svn add . --force
```

You can check what has been modified with:

svn status | grep '^\!' | sed 's/! *//' | xargs -I% svn rm %@

You then need to copy the trunk to the new version:

```
svn cp "trunk" "tags/1.0.1"
```

And then submit:

```
svn ci -m "Updated XYZ"
```

You will then see the updated version here: https://wordpress.org/plugins/salesfire/.

(It may take several minutes to reflect bump.)
